## [**Overview**](http://docs.nativescript.org/core-concepts/events#overview)

An event is a message sent from an event emitter to signify the occurrence of a specific action. This action can be generated by a user action \(such as a tap\) or by program logic \(for instance, to indicate that downloading an image from a server has completed\). The object that raises the event is called an **event sender** \(simply **sender**\) or **event raiser**. The object that consumes the event is called an **event listener** \(simply **listener**\) or **event handler**.

The NativeScript framework provides a class `Observable` that powers the process of working with events. Find more information about it in the [API Reference](http://docs.nativescript.org/api-reference/classes/_data_observable_.observable.html). Because it is one of the base classes within the NativeScript framework, almost every NativeScript object \(component\) has an option for dealing with events.
