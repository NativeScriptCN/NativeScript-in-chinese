Overview

NativeScript lets you access all native APIs from the underlying platform. To achieve this behaviour, many things happen under the hood. One of them is marshalling - the conversion between JavaScript and Objective-C data types for iOS and Java data types for Android.

In this article, you will learn how to call native APIs from JavaScript with various data types parameters. For more information, see the platform-specific resources about data conversion in theiOS Runtime and Android Runtime sections.
